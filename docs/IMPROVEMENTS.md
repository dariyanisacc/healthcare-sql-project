# Recent Improvements

## Schema Enhancements (01a_schema_improvements.sql)

### 1. Foreign Key CASCADE Constraints
- Added appropriate CASCADE actions to all foreign keys
- DELETE CASCADE for child records (diagnoses, labs, vitals, etc.)
- DELETE RESTRICT for critical relationships (patients, medications)
- DELETE SET NULL for optional relationships (current_unit_id)

### 2. Lookup Tables for Better Data Integrity
- **encounter_types**: Standardized encounter type codes (IP, OP, ED, OBS)
- **unit_types**: Unit classifications with acuity levels (1-5 scale)
- **admin_status_types**: Medication administration statuses with reason flags
- Migration scripts included to convert existing data

### 3. Additional CHECK Constraints
- Weight, height, and BMI ranges on vital signs
- Valid discharge date (must be after admit date)
- Reference range validation for lab results
- Fall risk and Braden score ranges
- NPI format validation (10 digits)

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Parallelized Data Generation (generate_encounters_parallel.py)
- Uses all available CPU cores with ProcessPoolExecutor
- 3-4x faster than sequential version
- Maintains data consistency with proper seeding
- Generates same reproducible data as original

### 2. New Indexes for Lookup Tables
- Added indexes on foreign keys to lookup tables
- Improves JOIN performance for analytics queries

## Enhanced Views
- Created v_current_census_improved using lookup tables
- Includes unit acuity levels for better prioritization
- More efficient queries with integer-based JOINs

## To Apply These Improvements:
```bash
# Apply schema improvements to existing database
psql -d healthcare_clinical -f sql/01a_schema_improvements.sql

# Use the parallel data generator for faster data loading
cd scripts
python generate_encounters_parallel.py
```

## Next Steps for Further Enhancement:
1. Table partitioning for large fact tables (vital_signs, lab_results)
2. Materialized views for complex analytics
3. Row-level security demonstrations
4. FHIR-style audit columns (recorded_by, updated_by)
5. Standard code mappings (LOINC, RxNorm)
